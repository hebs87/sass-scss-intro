/*---------------------------------------Scss as scripting language with mixins*/
/*similar to placeholders, but you pass parameters and arguments, so they are similar to functions in that way
    used for code you want to reuse*/
/*mixin (with logic - optional)
1. create @mixin called button
2. have two arguments: $color and $size
3. set width to $size, height to half the $size, and border to $color, so it will be the same as the text color
4. create if statement:
    a. if $color is equal to #e84610, color will be white
    b. else color will be $color
*/
/*to call the mixin
1. when we want to create a button, we'll use the class name of .btn
2. we use the @include followed by the name of the mixin (button)
3. pass the actual values: color and size
    this replaces $color and $size arguments in the .btn class - this is shown in main css
*/

  width: 200px;
  height: 100px;

/*content directive within a mixin
1. create a mixin called example with no arguments or parameters
2. give it some properties for bg-color and font color
3. create a content directive using @content
4. give content directive some properties for font-size and font-weight
*/
/*to call the mixin with content directive
1. we want to include this mixin on a paragraph
2. call the mixin
3. add properties into the mixin
